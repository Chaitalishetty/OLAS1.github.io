            Climate change is real and so is the need to reverse it. This is not news to any of us. And I know we all want to make a difference. But the question is how do we reverse climate change and also advance our development as a nation, together. <br>     
            80% of the vehicles sold in India today are two wheelers and despite that only 12% of India owns a two wheeler. These vehicles consume 12,000 cr liters of fuel every year and are responsible for 40% of air pollution. <br>           
            Clearly, this penetration is going to grow exponentially in the coming years and we simply cannot allow that to happen. So moving to EVs is no longer optional, it's crucial.<br>
            But a shift like this requires innovation and manufacturing at a global scale and quality. That’s what we have been upto with the Ola Futurefactory – the largest 2W factory in the world – and that’s what we are introducing in the market today. It’s a revolution on two wheels. It’s called the <b>Ola S1</b> and it is, quite simply, the best scooter ever made. </h5><br>
